"""Loads a frozen OPD teacher's LM head for full-vocab KL reconstruction.

`--teacher-score-mode full_vocab` ships only the teacher's last-layer hidden state per
response position (see `compute_teacher_log_probs` in
orbit/rollout/generate_utils/generate_endpoint_utils.py), not its full vocab logits --
transmitting a vocab-sized vector per token over HTTP would be far more expensive. The
training side reconstructs the teacher's full logits itself by multiplying that hidden
state through the teacher's own LM head (`hidden_state @ lm_head.weight.T`), which this
module loads once per process and caches -- sharded along the vocabulary to match Megatron's
partition of the student's output layer when tensor parallelism is on.
